    Back inside your CLI, use the cd command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer)
    Use the git clone <link-to-repo> command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in.

    Use the git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on)
